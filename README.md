# GUI
Replacement for LabVIEW dual-lick task. Allows parameters to be changed, experiment to be run, and behavioral data to be saved.

Requires an arduino board to be connected to the same computer. Establishes connection with the board when run. Parameters can be changed using the edit fields provided. Most fields have context menus when right-clicked. The "Start Experiment" button will begin the experiment, and any orange or red buttons will end it. Behavioral data will be saved in 4 different files in a desktop folder called Behavior_Data
